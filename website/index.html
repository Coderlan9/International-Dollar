            <p>About 5,000 years ago that the Mesopotamian people created the shekel, which <br>
                is considered the first known form of currency. Since then, we have come a <br>
                long way in our monetary system. From Gold and Silver coins, to banknotes,<br>
                to wire transfers and eventually to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, the first<br>
                cryptocurrency created in 2009, has started a revolution, spawning a number<br>
                of new coins based on the same blockchain technology. Now in 2022 this <br>
                project is the next step in our fiscal evolution. With a simple majority<br>
                based voting algorithm, we believe that we can deliver the same security<br>
                as the Bitcoin Blockchain. You might ask why we didn't choose the<br>
                trusted blockchain? Well our algorithm has a lot of advantages over a <br>
                blockchain, these range from instant and free transactions to 99.9% <br>
                less energy consumption. But most importantly, we do not seek a financial <br>
                gain from this project, all International Dollars will be slowly and  <br>
                equally distributed across the community. This is not about getting rich <br>
                quick, this is about creating a fair financial system one step at a time.&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            <p>About 5,000 years ago that the Mesopotamian people created the shekel,<br>
                which is considered the first known form of currency. Since then,<br>
                we have come a long way in our monetary system. From Gold and Silver<br>
                coins, to banknotes, to wire transfers and eventually to<br>
                cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency created in 2009,<br>
                has started a revolution, spawning a number of new coins based<br>
                on the same blockchain technology. Now in 2022 this project is<br>
                the next step in our fiscal evolution. With a simple majority based<br>
                voting algorithm, we believe that we can deliver the same security<br>
                as the Bitcoin Blockchain. You might ask why we didn't choose the<br>
                trusted blockchain? Well our algorithm has a lot of advantages <br>
                ranging from instant and free transactions to 99.9% less energy <br>
                consumption. But most importantly, we do not seek a financial gain<br>
                from this project, all International Dollars will be slowly and<br>
                equally distributed across the community. This is not about getting<br>
                rich quick, this is about a fair financial system one step at a time.
